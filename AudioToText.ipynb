            "[50:44.000 --> 50:58.000]  And with each momentary thought, you are fueling the dynamo within your prostate, engorging it with hot, lustful blood.\n",
            "[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Good.\n",
            "[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Are you feeling that?\n",
            "[51:02.000 --> 51:07.000]  You are, aren't you?\n",
            "[51:07.000 --> 51:17.000]  As the next scene unfolds before your mind's eye, concentrate on the feelings coming from deep within you.\n",
            "[51:17.000 --> 51:25.000]  Located at that place where you feel that urge but can't quite touch.\n",
            "[51:25.000 --> 51:35.000]  That place inside where the tingle, tickle of sweet longing lives.\n",
            "[51:35.000 --> 51:47.000]  While concentrating on these inner sensations, feel your hands continuing their slow and light movement over your body.\n",
            "[51:47.000 --> 51:54.000]  Barely touching you, but exciting your flesh intensely.\n",
            "[51:54.000 --> 52:13.000]  With each momentary contact, a delicate note of pure pleasure is sent to every other nerve in your body.\n",
            "[52:13.000 --> 52:28.000]  Just let your hands slowly roam over your body, caressing you, teasing you, exciting you.\n",
            "[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  Now, do another squeeze.\n",
            "[52:32.000 --> 52:39.000]  Yes, that feels so good.\n",
            "[52:39.000 --> 52:58.000]  As your pleasure toy slowly and gently begins to beside you, rocking and pivoting deep inside your rectum.\n",
            "[52:58.000 --> 53:13.000]  Each contraction and stroke of that dynamic little toy acts like a bellows to blow innervating oxygen at your radiant prostate ember.\n",
            "[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  You can feel it heating up inside, can't you?\n",
            "[53:18.000 --> 53:30.000]  Yes, it feels so nice to be stroked by this wonderful little toy.\n",
            "[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  And your prostate begins to swell with appreciation.\n",
            "[53:36.000 --> 53:48.000]  You are probably feeling the beginnings of the pulsing, surging pleasure waves being emitted by your prostate.\n",

            "[54:02.000 --> 54:14.000]  As you move your hands slowly up towards your nipples, you feel like you are drawing a charge of static electricity across your skin.\n",
            "[54:14.000 --> 54:25.000]  That charge is causing those little buds of excitable flesh to proudly pump themselves up, adoring the attention you are giving them.\n",
            "[54:25.000 --> 54:42.000]  As you now begin tickling, rubbing and teasing your nipples, I can almost see the blood rushing into each sensitive bud as they become plump and so very alive.\n",
            "[54:42.000 --> 54:49.000]  That feels really good, doesn't it?\n",
            "[54:49.000 --> 55:01.000]  You now start circling each nipple faster and faster with the lightest possible touch, occasionally stopping to rapidly flick them.\n",
            "[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  Oh yes, that feels really nice.\n",
            "[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  I can feel the same excitement in my nipples as I see in yours.\n",
            "[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  I'm feeling so hot.\n",
            "[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  This is really getting to be fun.\n",
            "[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  Just watching you is turning me on.\n",
            "[55:22.000 --> 55:29.000]  This feels so good, so right, so exciting.\n",
            "[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[55:33.000 --> 55:47.000]  Each little flick of the fingertip across that tender tit elicits a trickle charge straight to your prostate and to my pussy and glit.\n",
            "[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  Watching you play with yourself like this is really getting me hot and wet now.\n",
            "[55:53.000 --> 56:06.000]  And I can see by the flare of your nostrils you are enjoying the sweet, pungent fragrance of my arousal as well.\n",
            "[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  Stroke by slow stroke, your toy is exciting your prostate.\n",
            "[56:11.000 --> 56:22.000]  Each stroke coaxes another delightful ripple of joy to radiate outward, whispering needful urgency for release.\n",
            "[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Oh, sweet release.\n",
            "[56:26.000 --> 56:33.000]  Yes, so nice.\n",
            "[56:33.000 --> 56:41.000]  You may suddenly find that you no longer consciously control the contractions at your asshole.\n",
            "[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  Isn't it deliciously sweet when this happens?\n",
            "[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  You are now more aroused than I have ever seen you,\n",
            "[56:51.000 --> 57:03.000]  which adds to the exciting mystery you and your wondrous toy create each and every time we play here together.\n",
            "[57:03.000 --> 57:08.000]  I really do love watching you pleasure yourself like this.\n",
            "[57:08.000 --> 57:29.000]  Just watching you tremble and writhe as the waves of pleasure wash o'er you and seeing your bay beautiful cock twitch and ooze pre-cum is all so exciting to me.\n",
            "[57:29.000 --> 57:38.000]  As your titillating little toy continues its slow pace of gently massaging your prostate,\n",
            "[57:38.000 --> 57:58.000]  you feel each small stroke and accompanying involuntary contractions nuzzing and nuzzling you through a symphony of movements all pushing you higher and higher in excitement.\n",
            "[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  And it all feels so good.\n",
            "[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  So good.\n",

            "[58:29.000 --> 58:40.000]  Each slowly held stroke is arousing you more and more, nudging you toward that bridge of sighs.\n",
            "[58:40.000 --> 58:47.000]  You know it's perfectly natural for you to express those feelings with sighs and moans.\n",
            "[58:47.000 --> 58:57.000]  I just love it when I hear you moan and growl as you respond to your toy's tantalizing, teasing stimulation.\n",
            "[58:57.000 --> 59:04.000]  It's so hot to hear and there's no reason to hold back anything now.\n",
            "[59:05.000 --> 59:11.000]  Just surrender yourself to the pleasure.\n",
            "[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  Yes, that's it.\n",
            "[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  Surrender.\n",
